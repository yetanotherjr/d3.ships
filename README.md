# d3.ships
Use D3.js Edge Bundling to display ships between RPG characters

## What ?

This is a simple adaptation of [Ckothari's Demo](https://bl.ocks.org/ckothari/473320621a15a7ee1ed684bf3feb4255), with
 - A simple structure (don't need hierarchy, for now)
 - Different type of links (anything NOT "name" in the JSON is a type of link
 - Automatic CSS class name for lazy and efficient selection

## What for ?

To display all types of relationships between characters. In color !
